  <h3>Kerry's<br>Kites!</h3>
  <p>Since 2007 <br> that allow you to create a unique website. My teacher is great, so committed to
my learning and clearly <br> passionate about his craft. I look forward to all the things I will
learn and in time having the skills to create my own websites! #codingislyfe</p>
<p>A website that I particularly enjoy browsing both for its content and layout is
  <a href="www.oystermag.com">Oyster Magazine!</a> </p>

<p> Here is a blissful dog. <p>

<p>Hello! This is Sam, entering code-land in Code Class. I've just updated the dog pic, to... a cat pic.
  My experience with 'coding' I do feel is rather limited. I feel much may have progressed since my time at
  at university. So, as a result it may take me a little to get used to all of the new Tech. I look forward to
  exploring this new 'tech' landscape!<p>
